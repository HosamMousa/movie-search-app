# Movie Search App

This is a simple Vue.js application that allows users to search and filter a list of movies using The Movie Database API. It displays a list of popular movies and allows users to search for a movie by title. Below the list of movies, there is a statistics section that shows the number of titles with vote_average over 7, the number of titles with vote_average less than 5, the total votes count of all movies in the list, and the percent of Action titles of all titles in the list.
